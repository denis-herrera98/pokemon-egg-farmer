**TODO**

 1. Windows compatibility.
 2. Stop saving images to the disk. Allow OCR to process images without the need of writing it to the disk.
 3. Display sounds when the user needs to manually execute an action.
 4. Optimize sleep times when executing actions.
 5. Avoid using sleep times. Look for a way to confirm that an action was properly executed.
 6. Only send keystrokes to PokeMMO
